jarvis
======

Jarvis is just a simple calculator app writen in python

It isn't recomended that you use the installer. This is a fairly simple python program that make use of a few dependancies.

Dependencies needed: python3.2, xsel, python3-tk, gnuplot, concalc

Running the installer will attempt to use apt-get to install it's dependancies, 
assuming it can detect your operating system as debian, ubuntu or mint.

Running the uninstaller will remove the jarvis files from the places it installed
them but leave the dependancies.
